# If your BookStack uses a self-signed or otherwise invalid TLS certificate,
# you can disable certificate verification by setting:
#
# BOOKSTACK_INSECURE=1
#
# This will disable TLS verification and suppress warnings. Use ONLY for
# local/testing setups or when you trust the network â€” not recommended for
# production environments. A safer alternative is to provide the CA cert:
#
# BOOKSTACK_CA_CERT=C:\path\to\ca.pem
